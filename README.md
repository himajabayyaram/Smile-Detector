# Smile Detection with Arduino LED

This project uses OpenCV and C++ to detect a human smile in real-time through a webcam.

When a smile is detected, a signal is sent to an Arduino Uno via serial communication, and an LED connected on a breadboard lights up.

## Technologies Used
- OpenCV
- C++
- Arduino Uno
- LED + Breadboard

## Features
- Real-time face and smile detection
- Hardware LED indicator when smile is detected

## Repository Files
**Source-Code-File**
- Contains the complete implementation of the project.
        **Demenstration Video File**
- Shows the working of the project through a real time demo.
